# SimMarkets

SimMarkets is a tool to simulate simple markets with buyers, sellers and arbitrageurs. Currently, the user can choose the number of arbitraguers. This simulates a supply chain from seller to buyer including middle men.

The implementation aims to reproduce and extend the findings of the paper ["Tracking the invisible hand"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=273996) by Sunder and Bosch.

In the future we will include hierarchical organizations that allow to fine tune the interactions between agents. We will also allow the arbitrageurs to speculate.
